The editors in CodePen respond well to my speech recognition software

When I found myself having difficulty arranging elements in a flex container, in which the first row would contain a single element, and the final two rows would contain three elements each – for a total of seven. The problem was getting the first element – a heading element (h1) – to occupy all of the first line. Instead, it wanted to share a line with the other in-line elements. Eventually I figured out that setting the width of the header element to the maximum would push all other elements to the next line.

Ideally I wanted a single "flex container" that would be universally applicable. Eventually, however, I discovered that some elements using the flex container class had unique requirements. To address those requirements, I elected to use in-line styles.

For each section in the document, I used CodePen for proof of concept testing.

I'm thinking of using a photograph for the webpage's background, but I'm wondering whether it might be too busy.

I'm bothered by the links in the navigation bar that don't have the standard decoration. It's always a little tricky when you have a number of multi-word links on the same row. If there Quite often there's nothing to distinguish where one link ends and another begins. My experience has been that single-word links are easier to decipher.

I was fiddling around with the site when I inadvertently deleted the headers background. While perusing the code to figure what I had done, I happened to glance up at the page. Much to my surprise, I found the new look rather pleasing. Although I figured out how I had deleted the background, I decided to leave well enough alone. It was a lucky accident.
